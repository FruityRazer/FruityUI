# FruityUI

Open-source UI for [FruityRazer](https://github.com/FruityRazer/FruityRazer), open-source Razer drivers for macOS.

The app should be stable, but is still in its early stages.

If you just want to use it, check the [Releases](https://github.com/FruityRazer/FruityUI/releases) page. Developer ID signed releases are published there.

Please note that since this app uses SwiftUI, it only supports macOS 10.15 and up. Users of older versions of macOS may try [FruityUI Legacy](https://github.com/FruityRazer/FruityUI-Legacy) ([Releases](https://github.com/FruityRazer/FruityUI-Legacy/releases)), but please note that version is unsupported.
